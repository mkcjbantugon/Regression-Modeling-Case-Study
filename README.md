## Objective
The bike sharing industry has grown tremendously in recent years, with an estimated global value of $2.8 billion in 2023. This is due to a number of factors, such as convenience, sustainability, and physical fitness. As a result of the market's growth, your client, a major city in the United States, has tasked you with developing a machine learning model to predict the number of bike rentals on a given day, as well as to provide insights into the factors that contribute to bike rental demand.

## Your Client
The Cook County Planning and Development Department, responsible for the Chicago metropolitan area in the United States.

## Requirement
You must have Python installed in your computer in order to run the code.

Download the jupyter notebook file "Bantugon_MKCJ_Complete Analysis.ipynb" (2.23 MB) to your computer. Run your terminal window to access jupyter notebook and go to the folder where you save the file and run.
